### Files
- **File S1** contains the results of the original dose response HTA. 
- **File S2** contains the residual phenotypic values for all 159 set 1 RIAILs, 296 set 2 RIAILs, and parent strains (N2 and CB4856) in response to all eight chemotherapeutics. 
- **File S3** contains the linkage mapping results for the set 2 RIAILs for all 24 drug-response traits tested in the HTA. 
- **File S4** contains the genotype of the NILs in the study. 
- **File S5** contains the raw pruned phenotypes for the NIL dose response with the modified HTA.
